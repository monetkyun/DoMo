      <h1>Happy Anniversary, My Love ♡ </h1>
      <p>Thank you for the past 1 months, and all the time we've spent together.</p>
      <p>In this human life span I never thought I would ever love. But here I am, accidentally fell in love with you. It's the best accident of my life. To be able to cherish your existence. To admire you. Your kindness, your warmth, your eyes, your beautiful face, the way you laugh, the way you position yourself in your room. You are never an accident but quite the opposite; perfection. But in my life that full of accidents, it leads me to you. The only perfect thing. A feeling overwhelmed me, one that living beings can not comprehend. It's love. I'm convinced that people never experienced love like this, not even a fraction of it. You showed me the type of love that only gods can give. It makes me believed that you are one of them. At least mine. My only god that I wouldn't want to share with anyone else. It truly feels like a blessing, and I don't have to worry about anything anymore now that I have your love. You are the best person in this world, the best boyfriend, the best friend, the best company and possibly, the best future husband.</p>
      <p>I look forward to our future and things that we will accomplish together. I truly adore you. I can't even believe that such a beautiful thing can exist in this cruel world. This world doesn’t deserve you. I don’t know how I get to hold you like this either, but I will forever be grateful of the fact. Most of my time spent with you are the happiest moments ever. You assured me that I’m still capable of love. And I have came to love the most precious thing to ever exist. I haven’t felt actually suicidal in my time with you. Despite still recovering after a failed attempt. And I have to thank you for that. Thank you for everything, my love.
